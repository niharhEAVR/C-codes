### **What is a Structure in C?**

In C, a **structure** (also called `struct`) is a user-defined data type that groups different types of variables under one name. Structures are used to represent complex data more efficiently by combining related variables into a single unit.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Combines Different Data Types**:
   - A structure can hold variables of different types (e.g., integers, floats, arrays).
2. **Efficient Data Organization**:
   - Structures are useful for organizing data logically, like representing a record in a database.
3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - All variables in a structure are stored contiguously in memory.

### **Why Use Structures?**

1. **Group Related Data**:
   - Example: Representing a student with `name`, `roll number`, and `marks`.
2. **Improves Code Readability**:
   - Easier to understand and manage related data as a single entity.
3. **Foundation for Complex Data Structures**:
   - Structures form the basis for arrays of structures, linked lists, trees, etc.

### **Defining a Structure**

A structure is defined using the `struct` keyword.

#### **Syntax**:
```c
struct structure_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    ...
};
```

#### **Example**:
```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int roll_no;
    float marks;
};
```

- **`struct Student`**: Defines a structure named `Student`.
- **Members**: `name`, `roll_no`, and `marks`.

### **Using a Structure**

1. **Declaring a Structure Variable**:
   ```c
   struct Student s1;
   ```

2. **Accessing Members**:
   Use the **dot operator (`.`)** to access members of a structure.
   ```c
   s1.roll_no = 1;
   s1.marks = 95.5;
   ```

3. **Input and Output**:
   ```c
   printf("Enter name: ");
   scanf("%s", s1.name);
   printf("Name: %s, Roll No: %d, Marks: %.2f", s1.name, s1.roll_no, s1.marks);
   ```

### **Example Program**

#### **Program to Store and Display Student Information**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int roll_no;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1;

    // Input
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", s1.name);
    printf("Enter roll number: ");
    scanf("%d", &s1.roll_no);
    printf("Enter marks: ");
    scanf("%f", &s1.marks);

    // Output
    printf("\nStudent Details:\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
    printf("Roll No: %d\n", s1.roll_no);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Advanced Concepts with Structures**

1. **Array of Structures**:
   Store multiple records of the same type.
   ```c
   struct Student students[5];
   ```

2. **Pointer to Structure**:
   Use pointers to access structure members.
   ```c
   struct Student *ptr = &s1;
   printf("Name: %s\n", ptr->name); // Use '->' operator
   ```

3. **Nested Structures**:
   Structures within structures for hierarchical data.
   ```c
   struct Address {
       char city[50];
       int pin;
   };

   struct Student {
       char name[50];
       struct Address addr;
   };
   ```

4. **Typedef with Structures**:
   Simplify structure declarations.
   ```c
   typedef struct {
       char name[50];
       int roll_no;
   } Student;

   Student s1; // No need to write "struct"
   ```

### **Advantages of Structures**
1. **Logical Grouping**:
   - Combines related data into a single unit.
2. **Code Reusability**:
   - Structures can be reused across programs.
3. **Supports Complex Data Structures**:
   - Useful for building arrays of structures, linked lists, and more.

---

### **Limitations of Structures**
1. **No Methods**:
   - Unlike classes in Object-Oriented Programming, structures in C cannot have functions as members.
2. **No Data Hiding**:
   - All members are public by default.

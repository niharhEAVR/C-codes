In a `switch` statement, **two cases cannot have the same value** because it would lead to ambiguity. Here's why:

### **1. Ambiguity in Execution**
The purpose of a `switch` statement is to select one specific case to execute based on the value of the expression. If two cases have the same value, the compiler or interpreter would not know which case to execute. For example:

```c
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        printf("Case 1");
        break;
    case 1: // Duplicate case
        printf("Duplicate Case 1");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Default");
}
```
This creates a conflict because the compiler cannot determine which `case 1` should be executed when `x` equals `1`.

### **2. Compilation Error**
Most programming languages with `switch` statements (e.g., C, C++, Java, JavaScript) enforce unique case values. During compilation, the compiler checks for duplicate case values and throws an error if it finds any. This ensures that the `switch` statement behaves predictably.

### **3. Logical Consistency**
Each `case` is meant to represent a unique branch of logic. Allowing duplicate cases would break the structure and intent of the `switch` statement. For example, consider:

```c
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        // Some logic
        break;
    case 2:
        // Different logic
        break;
    case 1: // Duplicate case
        // Confusing logic
        break;
}
```
This would confuse both the programmer and the compiler, as it violates the principle of having distinct branches for distinct values.

### **4. Default Case Handles Undefined Behavior**
If a value doesn't match any case, the `default` case (if provided) is executed. This avoids the need for duplicate cases to handle the same value.

---

To summarize: 
- Allowing duplicate case values would make the behavior of the `switch` statement ambiguous.
- To maintain logical consistency and predictable execution, programming languages enforce unique case values.

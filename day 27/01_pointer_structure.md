Great question! Let's break it down and understand **why a pointer is used in the parameter** of the `displayStudent` function.

---

### **The Role of the Pointer in the Parameter**

#### Function Signature:
```c
void displayStudent(struct student *ptr, int n);
```

Here, `struct student *ptr` means the function accepts a **pointer to an array of structures**. This is done for several reasons:

---

### **1. Efficient Memory Usage**
When you pass a pointer to a function, you are only passing the **address** of the data, not the entire data itself. This is more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large arrays or structures.

- **Without a Pointer**:  
  If you passed the entire structure array directly (by value), the compiler would create a copy of the entire array in memory. This would use more memory and slow down the program.
  
- **With a Pointer**:  
  Only the memory address of the array is passed. The function can access the original array directly without creating a copy.

---

### **2. Allows Modification of Original Data**
Using a pointer gives the function direct access to the original array. If needed, the function can modify the array's contents.

- In your code, the `displayStudent` function only reads the data, but if you wanted to modify the `marks` or `roll` values, the changes would directly affect the original array.

---

### **3. Compatibility with Arrays**
In C, when you pass an array to a function, it is automatically treated as a pointer to the first element of the array.  
So, `struct student st[100]` in `main()` is equivalent to passing `struct student *ptr` to the function.

---

### **How the Pointer Works in the Code**

1. **Pointer as a Parameter**:
   ```c
   void displayStudent(struct student *ptr, int n)
   ```
   - `ptr[i]` accesses the `i`th element of the array using pointer arithmetic.
   - This is equivalent to `st[i]` in the `main()` function.

2. **Accessing Members**:
   ```c
   printf("Student Name: %s\n", ptr[i].name);
   ```
   - The pointer `ptr` points to the array of structures.
   - `ptr[i]` accesses the `i`th structure in the array.
   - `ptr[i].name`, `ptr[i].roll`, and `ptr[i].marks` access the members of the `i`th structure.

---

### **What Happens in Memory**
- **In `main()`**:
  - The array `st` is created in memory.
  - Each `struct student` occupies contiguous memory.

- **When `displayStudent(st, n)` is called**:
  - The address of the first element of the array (`st`) is passed to `displayStudent`.
  - Inside the function, `ptr` points to the same memory as `st` in `main()`. No data is copied.

---

### **Why Not Use the Array Directly?**
While you could write:
```c
void displayStudent(struct student st[], int n);
```
This is essentially the same as using a pointer because arrays decay into pointers when passed to functions. The pointer (`*ptr`) explicitly signals that the function is working with a reference to the original data.

---

### **Simplified Example**
Here's a minimal example to illustrate:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct student {
    char name[30];
    int roll;
    int marks;
};

void displayStudent(struct student *ptr, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Name: %s, Roll: %d, Marks: %d\n", ptr[i].name, ptr[i].roll, ptr[i].marks);
    }
}

int main() {
    struct student st[2] = { {"Alice", 1, 85}, {"Bob", 2, 90} };
    displayStudent(st, 2); // Pass the address of the array
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Key Takeaway**
Using a pointer (`struct student *ptr`) allows the function to:
1. Access the original array without copying it.
2. Efficiently read or modify the data.
3. Work seamlessly with arrays since arrays are treated as pointers when passed to functions.

If a pointer is **not passed** to the function in your program, and instead the array of structures is passed **by value**, several issues arise:

---

### **1. Copying the Entire Array**
When you pass an array of structures **by value**, the entire array is copied into the function's local memory. This has several consequences:

- **Increased Memory Usage**:
  - For large arrays, copying consumes a significant amount of memory.
  - Example: If your `struct student` is 40 bytes and the array has 100 elements, passing it by value would copy 4000 bytes into the function.

- **Performance Overhead**:
  - Copying the array takes extra time, making the program slower.

#### **Code Example Without Pointer**:
```c
void displayStudent(struct student st[100], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Student Name: %s\n", st[i].name);
    }
}
```

- **Drawback**: The array is copied, leading to inefficiency.

---

### **2. Cannot Modify the Original Array**
If the array is passed by value, the function works on a **copy** of the array, not the original array. Any changes made to the array inside the function will **not reflect** in the original array.

#### **Example**:
```c
void modifyMarks(struct student st[100], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        st[i].marks += 5; // Add 5 marks
    }
}

int main() {
    struct student st[2] = { {"Alice", 1, 85}, {"Bob", 2, 90} };
    modifyMarks(st, 2); // Changes won't reflect in the original array
    printf("%d\n", st[0].marks); // Still prints 85, not 90
    return 0;
}
```

- **Why?**: The `modifyMarks` function works on a copy of the array, leaving the original array unchanged.

---

### **3. Function Parameter Mismatch**
If you attempt to pass an array directly without using a pointer and the function is defined to accept a pointer, you'll get a **type mismatch error**.

#### Example:
```c
void displayStudent(struct student *ptr, int n);

int main() {
    struct student st[100];
    displayStudent(st, 5); // This works because arrays decay to pointers

    displayStudent(&st, 5); // Incorrect: Passing the address of the array
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Why Pointers Solve These Issues**

1. **No Copying**:
   - When a pointer is passed, only the **address** of the array is passed, not the entire array. This avoids memory and performance overhead.

2. **Direct Access to Original Array**:
   - Changes made through the pointer reflect in the original array because the pointer refers to the same memory location.

3. **Efficient for Large Data**:
   - For large arrays or structures, passing a pointer is much more efficient than copying the data.

---

### **What Happens When You Pass the Array Directly?**

In C, when you pass an array to a function, the array name decays into a pointer to the first element of the array. So, in reality, passing the array directly (`displayStudent(st, n)`) is equivalent to passing a pointer (`displayStudent(&st[0], n)`).

#### **Equivalent Declarations**:
Both of these function signatures are essentially the same:
```c
void displayStudent(struct student *ptr, int n);
void displayStudent(struct student st[], int n);
```

- In both cases, the function receives a pointer to the first element of the array.

---

### **What if You Donâ€™t Use Pointers at All?**
If you explicitly try to avoid pointers and pass structures by value, the program becomes inefficient and less flexible. Pointers are the idiomatic way in C to handle arrays and structures, especially when working with functions.

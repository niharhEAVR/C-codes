An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a task. It can be represented in textual form (steps or pseudocode) or visually (flowcharts or diagrams). Let's break this down:

### **Algorithm (Textual Explanation)**
1. **Definition**: A sequence of steps or instructions to achieve a specific goal.
2. **Characteristics**:
   - **Finiteness**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
   - **Definiteness**: Each step must be clear and unambiguous.
   - **Input**: It may have zero or more inputs.
   - **Output**: It produces at least one output.
   - **Effectiveness**: All steps must be basic enough to be executed by a person or machine.

**Example**: Algorithm for finding the largest number in a list:
   1. Start.
   2. Initialize `max` to the first element of the list.
   3. For each element in the list:
      - If the element is greater than `max`, update `max`.
   4. Output `max`.
   5. End.

### **Graphical Representation of an Algorithm**
The graphical version is typically represented using a **flowchart**. A flowchart uses different shapes to denote different actions:
- **Oval**: Start/End.
- **Rectangle**: Process/Instruction.
- **Diamond**: Decision (Yes/No or True/False).
- **Arrow**: Flow of control.

**Flowchart for Finding the Largest Number in a List**:
1. **Start**: Represented by an oval.
2. **Initialize `max`**: Represented by a rectangle.
3. **Loop Through List**: Represented by a rectangle and connected with arrows.
4. **Decision**: Check if the current element is greater than `max` (diamond shape).
5. **Update `max`**: If true, update `max` (rectangle).
6. **End Loop**: After iterating through the list, stop.
7. **Output `max`**: Represented by a rectangle.
8. **End**: Represented by an oval.


To explain the graphical representation of an algorithm using shapes, I'll create a simple C program and map each part of the program to its corresponding shape in a flowchart. Let's take the example of a program that calculates the sum of two numbers.

### **C Program**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;

    // Input two numbers
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num1);

    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num2);

    // Calculate the sum
    sum = num1 + num2;

    // Output the result
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Flowchart Shapes and Corresponding Code**

Hereâ€™s how each shape in a flowchart maps to the program:

1. **Oval (Start/End)**:
   - **Start**: This represents the beginning of the program.
     ```c
     int main() {
     ```
   - **End**: This represents the end of the program.
     ```c
     return 0;
     ```

2. **Parallelogram (Input/Output)**:
   - Input: Represents taking input from the user.
     ```c
     printf("Enter the first number: ");
     scanf("%d", &num1);
     ```
   - Output: Represents displaying the result to the user.
     ```c
     printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
     ```

3. **Rectangle (Process/Instruction)**:
   - Represents processing steps, such as calculations or assignments.
     ```c
     sum = num1 + num2;
     ```

4. **Arrow (Flow)**:
   - Indicates the flow of control from one step to another.

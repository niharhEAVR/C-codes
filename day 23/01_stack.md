Yes, the **call stack** process is happening in your code because the `facto` function uses **direct recursion**. Each recursive call to `facto` pushes a new frame onto the call stack, and once the base case is reached, the stack unwinds as each frame is popped off.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Call Stack Process**

#### **Code Flow**:
1. **`main()` calls `facto(n)`**:
   - `facto` is called with `n` (e.g., `n = 4`).
   - The result of `facto(n)` is stored in `r`.

2. **`facto(x)` executes recursively**:
   - For each call, a new stack frame is created to store:
     - The value of `x`.
     - The return address (where to go back after the function finishes).

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `x == 1`, the recursion stops, and `1` is returned.

4. **Stack Unwinding**:
   - The return values are multiplied as the stack unwinds, and each function call completes.

### **Call Stack for `n = 4`**

#### Recursive Calls (Stack Frames Pushed):
1. `facto(4)` â†’ Calls `facto(3)` â†’ Stack frame for `facto(4)` is pushed.
2. `facto(3)` â†’ Calls `facto(2)` â†’ Stack frame for `facto(3)` is pushed.
3. `facto(2)` â†’ Calls `facto(1)` â†’ Stack frame for `facto(2)` is pushed.
4. `facto(1)` â†’ Base case reached â†’ Returns `1`.

#### Unwinding the Stack (Stack Frames Popped):
1. `facto(2)` â†’ Returns `2 * 1 = 2` â†’ Frame for `facto(2)` is popped.
2. `facto(3)` â†’ Returns `3 * 2 = 6` â†’ Frame for `facto(3)` is popped.
3. `facto(4)` â†’ Returns `4 * 6 = 24` â†’ Frame for `facto(4)` is popped.
4. `main()` receives the result `24`.

### **Visual Representation of the Stack**

| **Stack (Top to Bottom)** | **Explanation**               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `facto(1)`                | Base case: returns `1`.       |
| `facto(2)`                | Returns `2 * facto(1)`.       |
| `facto(3)`                | Returns `3 * facto(2)`.       |
| `facto(4)`                | Returns `4 * facto(3)`.       |
| `main()`                  | Calls `facto(4)` and waits.   |

### **Key Points**
1. **Recursive Calls Push Frames**:
   Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, storing its own local variables (`x`) and the return address.

2. **Base Case Stops Recursion**:
   The recursion halts when `x == 1`, preventing infinite recursion.

3. **Stack Unwinding**:
   The return values are calculated as the stack unwinds (frames are popped).

4. **Stack Size**:
   For `n = 4`, the maximum stack depth is 4 (one frame for each recursive call).

### **Output for `n = 4`**
```
Enter the value of n: 4
The factorial value of 4 is 24
```

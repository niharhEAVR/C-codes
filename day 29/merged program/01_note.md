Your code is mostly correct and functional for merging the contents of two text files into a third file. However, there are some improvements and corrections you can make to ensure better error handling, portability, and clarity. Here's an improved version of your code:

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **File Mode for `fp3`**: Use `"w"` instead of `"a"` for `fp3` if you want to overwrite the file's contents every time the program runs. Using `"a"` appends to the file, which might not always be the desired behavior.
2. **Error Handling**: Add error handling for `fp3` as well.
3. **Close Files in All Cases**: Ensure all files are closed even if an error occurs.
4. **Variable Initialization**: Initialize variables like `ch` to avoid undefined behavior.
5. **Avoid Repeated Code**: Consider creating a helper function for copying file contents to make the code cleaner.

### Corrected and Improved Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to copy content from one file to another
void copyFileContent(FILE *source, FILE *destination) {
    char ch;
    while ((ch = fgetc(source)) != EOF) {
        fputc(ch, destination);
    }
}

int main() {
    FILE *fp1, *fp2, *fp3;

    // Open files
    fp1 = fopen("file-1.txt", "r");
    fp2 = fopen("file-2.txt", "r");
    fp3 = fopen("file-3.txt", "w"); // Use "w" to overwrite

    // Check if files opened successfully
    if (fp1 == NULL || fp2 == NULL || fp3 == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening files");
        if (fp1) fclose(fp1);
        if (fp2) fclose(fp2);
        if (fp3) fclose(fp3);
        exit(1);
    }

    // Copy content from file-1 to file-3
    copyFileContent(fp1, fp3);

    // Copy content from file-2 to file-3
    copyFileContent(fp2, fp3);

    printf("Files successfully merged into file-3.txt.\n");

    // Close all files
    fclose(fp1);
    fclose(fp2);
    fclose(fp3);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Helper Function**: `copyFileContent` is used to copy file contents, making the code reusable and cleaner.
2. **Error Handling**: Added checks for `fp3` and ensured all files are closed in case of an error.
3. **File Mode**: Changed mode of `fp3` to `"w"` to overwrite the file instead of appending.
4. **Loop Simplification**: Used `while ((ch = fgetc(source)) != EOF)` for simplicity and readability.

This updated code is robust, easier to maintain, and ensures proper file handling in all scenarios.

Good question! Let me clarify why error handling for `fp3` (the third file) is important, even if `file-1.txt` and `file-2.txt` are the focus of your checks.

### Why Add Error Handling for `fp3`?

1. **File Creation or Opening Issues**:  
   If `fp3` cannot be created or opened (e.g., due to insufficient permissions, disk space issues, or other system-level errors), the program will fail silently unless you explicitly check for this condition.

2. **Consistency in Error Handling**:  
   You are already checking `fp1` and `fp2` for errors. Including `fp3` in the error checks ensures that all file operations are consistently validated.

3. **Avoid Undefined Behavior**:  
   If `fp3` is `NULL` and you try to write to it (e.g., using `fputc`), the program will crash or exhibit undefined behavior.

4. **Better Debugging**:  
   If the program fails to merge files, proper error messages can help you identify whether the problem is with reading `file-1.txt`, `file-2.txt`, or writing to `file-3.txt`.

### Example Scenario:
Imagine a situation where:
- `file-1.txt` and `file-2.txt` exist and are readable.
- `file-3.txt` cannot be created (e.g., due to a lack of write permissions in the directory).

Without checking `fp3`, your program will:
- Start reading from `file-1.txt` and `file-2.txt`.
- Attempt to write to a `NULL` file pointer (`fp3`), causing a crash or silent failure.

By adding error handling for `fp3`, you can gracefully handle this situation and inform the user about the issue.

### Error Handling in the Code:
Hereâ€™s the relevant part:

```c
fp1 = fopen("file-1.txt", "r");
fp2 = fopen("file-2.txt", "r");
fp3 = fopen("file-3.txt", "w"); // Open file-3 for writing

if (fp1 == NULL || fp2 == NULL || fp3 == NULL) {
    perror("Error opening files");
    if (fp1) fclose(fp1); // Close if opened
    if (fp2) fclose(fp2); // Close if opened
    if (fp3) fclose(fp3); // Close if opened
    exit(1); // Exit the program
}
```

This ensures:
- If `fp3` fails to open, the program exits with a meaningful error message.
- No further operations are performed on invalid file pointers.

### Debugging Your Current Issue:
If `file-1.txt` and `file-2.txt` are empty, the merged file (`file-3.txt`) will also be empty. This is expected behavior. You can verify this by:
1. Adding some text to `file-1.txt` and `file-2.txt`.
2. Running the program again to confirm that the contents are merged into `file-3.txt`.

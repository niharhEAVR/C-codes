### Forgot about the code for now, but what we have to focus now is that c-program is a compiled language which means that when the program will compile at that time it will create a executable file (.exe) 

**1.** open the vs code terminal and go to the directory where this file is located

**2.** type this command, and you will get to see that a a.exe file has created 
```
gcc <file_name>.c
``` 
**3.** type this and the output will be shown
```
.\a.exe
```
